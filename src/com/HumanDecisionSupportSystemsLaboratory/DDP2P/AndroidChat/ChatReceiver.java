You only need to implement a class "AndroidChatReceiver"
that implements the interface "ChatReceiver" with its two functions
to receive a message, and a confirmation.

class AndroidChatReceiver implements ChatReceiver {
    // see documentation in file ChatReceiver.java
    public void receiveMessage(BigInteger first_in_this_sequence,
            BigInteger sequence, String msgStr, String peerName,
            String peer_GID, byte[] session_id, ChatMessage cmsg) {
        // TODO ...
    }
    // see documentation in file ChatReceiver.java
    public void confirmMessages(BigInteger sequence,
            ArrayList<BigInteger> out_of_sequence, String peer_GID,
            byte[] session_id) {
        // TODO ...
    }
}

Then somewhere in the initialization of your system, call:
AndroidChat.Main.receiver = new AndroidChatReceiver();

To send messages, call the function:
  
ChatMessage Main.sendMessage(String message, String peerGID, D_Peer peer);

The result of this function contains the "session_id and sequence" of your sent messages. Store them such that
you can flag in GUI their reception, confirmation that will contain this field.
